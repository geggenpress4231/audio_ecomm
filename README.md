Assignment 2-group project
Product service:-
We incorporated a product service whose model class takes in the parameters namely, ID, product name, description, price, image id and stock.
Subsequently, we implemented the repository, controller, and service class for the same.
Moreover, we created the docker file for it.
Order service:-
We followed the same procedure with order service, more or less the same way as product service, the parameters in the model class being customerId, OrderDate, total, and productDetails.
Along with the repository, controller, and service class, we also coded the docker file of it.
Image service:-
Housing the mandatory images for the products serves as an imperative part of our project.

In the end, we made the eureka service too configuring it at a different port, that is 8761.
Contributions:-
While Utsa worked on the product and order services, I worked on the eureka service and the docker images creation and building them up using docker build command.
After that, we discussed amongst ourselves and rectified the necessary errors and changes and pushed it to the git.
